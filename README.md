# Temporal Performance Modelling of Serverless Computing Platforms

This repository includes all artifacts for our paper "Temporal Performance Modelling of Serverless Computing Platforms" presented in the [Sixth International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC6) 2020
](https://www.serverlesscomputing.org/wosc6/). The performance model presented in our work is capable of predicting several key performance indicators of serverless computing platforms, while maintaining fidelity and tractabality thoughout the parameter space.

## Benefits

- Works with any service time distribution (general distribution).
- Predicts transient characteristics, making it a proper candidate for use in serverless computing management systems.
- Is tractable while having a high fidelity.

## Artifacts

- [Deployment code for collecting data using experimentations](https://github.com/pacslab/serverless-performance-modeling/tree/master/deployments)
- [Code for parsing the datasets and generating plots](./parsing-experiment-transient.ipynb)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PIP

## Installation
